## Metadata Field Report

The Metadata Field Report module is a fork of the [Field Report](https://www.drupal.org/project/field_report) 
module by George Anderson. This module creates a report (nested
under the 'Field List' report) that lists all bundle types and 
their fields, along with field properties/settings. 

Fields details listed include:
- machine name
- label
- description
- repeatable
- translatable
- target entity types (for entity reference fields)
- auto create (for entity reference fields)

You can also click "Download report" under each bundle 
type to download that bundle's info as a CSV.

This should make it easier to manage metadata in fields.
